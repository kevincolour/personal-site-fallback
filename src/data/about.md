# Intro

It's not everyday I get to talk about myself. In fact, it's today. 

# Some history

I immigrated to Canada from South Korea when I was six years old. I went to school, then more school, then even more school. Then I wrote apps, then more apps, and now am writing even more apps.

# Currently

I'm just trying to sort the grey from the blacks, finding the perfect smiley face emoji, and figuring out which surf is up next! 

# I dream of

truth and sanity. I dream of light in the night, of gentle breezes in the cold. To dream is to want and to want is to exist.
