      "Does anybody else have backup mugs that will never see promotion into daylight? They sit in the back patiently for their moment- the sweet sensation of literal fufillment... left behind the others. I actually know this one mug, lets call him muggy. Muggy's actually a really cool mug in most aspects, I bought him into this world a few years ago on a whim. Since then it's gotten accustomed to the dark side of the cupboard unfortunately. It's kind of a timing thing, you see. I have another mug very similar to Muggy in height and stature that I couldn't possbily be bothered to take out Muggy. It'll always be there if I need it though, I just don't know when that'll be. smug ",
